    body: [
      "Monaco was where Djokovic first put down roots outside Serbia. He bought a hillside apartment in the principality not long after turning professional as a teenager, joining a long list of top players — including Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev — who have based themselves there. The residence, believed to overlook the Mediterranean, functioned as his primary home for about 15 years and put him within easy reach of the Monte-Carlo Country Club, one of the sport's premier training facilities.",

      "Rather than a single trophy apartment in Manhattan, Djokovic bought two. In 2017 he spent over $10 million on a pair of SoHo units inside a glass-wrapped condominium designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano — reportedly located in different parts of the building, suggesting they were meant to function as separate living spaces rather than one combined unit.",
      "The purchase reflected as much an interest in architecture as in real estate; Djokovic has credited Piano's design as a major reason for the buy. The building, Piano's first residential project in the city, holds 115 units with soaring ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass, and private elevator access.",

Around the same time as the SoHo purchases, he paid $5.77 million for a penthouse atop one of the architect's boutique oceanfront buildings in Miami Beach, citing both the design and the fact that New York and Miami had become regular stops on his travel schedule.",
      "The roughly 2,400-square-foot unit paired minimalist interiors with unobstructed Atlantic views, in a building offering infinity pools, a spa, a fitness center, and a private library. Djokovic never actually lived there — he listed it almost as soon as construction wrapped in late 2019 and sold it in 2021 for $6 million.",

It holds three bedrooms, generous entertaining space, and a terrace with its own pool.",

            For more than two decades, Novak Djokovic has been rewriting
            tennis's record books. The Serbian star has collected 24 Grand Slam
            singles titles, over 100 ATP Tour-level wins, and nearly $194
            million in career prize money — more than any player in the sport's
            history. Even at 39, he remains a threat on the biggest stages,
            chasing an unprecedented 25th major while cementing a legacy that
            already ranks among the greatest in the sport.

          <p className="mt-5 font-serif-body text-[16px] leading-[1.75] text-[#332F29] md:text-[17px]">
            That success has made him one of tennis's highest earners off the
            court as well, with endorsement deals spanning Lacoste, Hublot,
            Asics, Aman, and NetJets contributing to an estimated $250 million
            fortune. Away from competition, he and his wife, Jelena — his
            longtime partner since high school — are raising their two children
            while running a growing set of ventures, including the Novak Tennis
            Academy and the Novak Djokovic Foundation, which funds early
            childhood education programs in Serbia.

            Like many top-earning athletes, Djokovic has put a meaningful share
            of that wealth into property, building a portfolio that spans from
            the Mediterranean coast to the mountains above Monaco. Here's a look
            at the homes he's owned over the years.
