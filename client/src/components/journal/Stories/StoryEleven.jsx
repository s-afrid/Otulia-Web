const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How many cars does Erling Haaland have?",
    a: "Haaland is reported to own at least 10 vehicles, ranging from performance SUVs and wagons to hypercars and a pickup truck. His collection includes models from Aston Martin, Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, and Shelby.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the most expensive car in Erling Haaland's collection?",
    a: "The Bugatti Tourbillon, with a reported price tag of $4.6 million, is the most expensive vehicle in his collection. It is a hybrid hypercar that makes 1,600 hp, and only 250 build slots were available.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Erling Haaland make per year?",
    a: "Haaland is reported to make around $60 million per year, which includes his salary at Manchester City and endorsement deals. His car collection represents a relatively modest portion of his annual income.",
  },
  {
    q: "What Ferrari models does Haaland own?",
    a: "Haaland reportedly owns several Ferraris, including a Monza SP2, an 812 Competizione Aperta, and a 12Cilindri. The Monza SP2, valued at $1.8 million, is a windscreen-less speedster that launched Ferrari's Icona Series.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Erling Haaland have a pickup truck?",
    a: "Yes, Haaland owns a Shelby F-150 Super Snake, which is a high-performance version of Ford's bestselling pickup. It features a 5.0-liter supercharged V-8 making up to 785 hp and starts at $138,495.",

Haaland may have been raised in and played for Norway, but he was born in the north of England in 2000 while his father was playing for Leeds United. Aston Martin may be best known for its James Bond-approved grand tourers and sports cars, but its current bestseller is its first SUV, the DBX. Haaland owns the 707 variant; with 697 hp under the hood, it was the most powerful version of the super SUV when it debuted in 2022 — the same year the soccer star signed with Manchester City.",

Enthusiasts have been swooning over the company's RS performance wagons since their debut in the mid-1990s, and the current RS 6 Avant may be the best of the bunch. The all-wheel-drive beast — which, unlike many of its predecessors, is available in the U.S. — is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 that makes just shy of 621 hp in its GT guise.",

The French marque's third distinct modern vehicle is an outlandish hybrid hypercar with a price tag to match. Deliveries of the vehicle, which makes 1,600 hp, have yet to commence, but it was reported last year that the player had secured one of its 250 build slots.",

But his most notable Prancing Horse is the Monza SP2. The windscreen-less speedster — which was available with one seat (the SP1) or two seats (the SP2) — was the model used to launch the automaker's Icona Series in 2018 and only 499 were built.",

The variant, which debuted near the end of the V-10's life cycle, is a supercar specifically engineered for off-roading, and it has the all-wheel-drive system and all-terrain tires to prove it.",

The forward owns one of the 275 AMG One examples that were built, but his most notable Mercedes is the Maybach S 680 Virgil Abloh. The saloon, which was released just months after the fashion designer's untimely passing, may be the most stylish vehicle Haaland owns.",

The most hard-core version of the German sports car maker's most iconic model is basically a street-legal race car. The lightweight two-door features a ridiculous aero kit and a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat six that makes well over 500 horses.",

                His team may not have made it to this weekend's final, but no
                one had as good of a World Cup as Erling Haaland. Not only did
                his goal-scoring efforts help push Norway to the quarterfinals
                of this year's tournament — its best finish at the quadrennial
                event ever — but he also managed to capture the hearts of the
                soccer-watching public while doing so.

                During his time in the U.S., Haaland proved himself to be so
                much more than a goal-scoring machine. In between his seven
                goals, the player joked around with kids before games and took
                time to soak up all America has to offer. The forward, who lines
                up for Manchester City during the club season, may be one of the
                game's best players, but he also has interests off the pitch.

                Goal-scoring records and Birkin bags aren't the only things
                Haaland has an eye for. He's also built one of the better car
                collections you'll see this year.

                Haaland's collection tells you something about his personality
                that the highlight reels don't. He appreciates driving dynamics,
                as the RS 6 Avant and GT3 RS attest. He's drawn to craft and
                exclusivity, as the Monza SP2 and Tourbillon prove. And he's
                practical enough to daily-drive a Cullinan and a pickup truck.
                For a 25-year-old who earns roughly $60 million a year, the
                garage is remarkably well-considered — not just a shopping
                spree, but a collection with taste.
